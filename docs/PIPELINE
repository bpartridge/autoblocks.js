PIPELINE

[clientElement] -> [elementSpec] -> [constraint],objective -> [update] -> [clientElement]

elementSpec:
  id: String
  centroid:
    x: Number
    y: Number
  width: Number
  height: Number
  children: [String] (without relative-position constraints)
  areaChildren: ?
    above: [String]?
    below: [String]?
    right: [String]?
    left: [String]?
  level: Number?

constraint:
  term:
    keys: String
    coeffs: Number
  maximum: Number

update:
  id: Number
  centroid:
    x: Number
    y: Number

A Binder registers a number of clientElements, to which it maintains references.
It can be queried at any time for an array [elementSpec], which should be stable.
It can also be sent an array [update], which it should update its clientElements.

A Constrainer is responsible for going from an array [elementSpec] to an array [constraint] and objective function.
It also must be able to reconstruct a set of updates from the variable values resulting from optimization.
